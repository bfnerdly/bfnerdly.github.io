<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 1.4em; font-size: 0.95em;">

<p>During my PhD in the Kelly Lab at Emory University, my research focused on the neural mechanisms of social behavior across non-model rodent species. I began by investigating how pair bonding affects nonapeptide-producing neurons in the prairie vole, <em>Microtus ochrogaster</em>. Using behavioral assays and immunohistochemistry, I found that pair bonding leads to a reduction in paraventricular (PVN) oxytocin neurons, which is reversed upon partner separation. I found similar results in Mongolian gerbils, <em>Meriones unguiculatus</em>.</p>

<p>Later, I studied the communally breeding spiny mouse, <em>Acomys dimidiatus</em>, to explore the neural circuits driving group affiliation. My work revealed that male spiny mice prefer larger social groups and use kinship cues to guide social decisions. Through chemogenetic manipulations, I identified a projection from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to the lateral septum (LS) that regulates group size preference. This work highlights how specialized neural circuitry may evolve in species with complex social structures and demonstrates the value of comparative approaches to studying social recognition and affiliation.</p>

<p>As a graduate student I also developed and validated several key experimental tools for use in spiny mice, including iDISCO, fiber photometry, CRISPR-Cas9, Cre-dependent chemogenetics, and neural tracing techniques.</p>

<p>In my postdoctoral work in the Elya Lab at Harvard University, I study how parasitic infections can manipulate animal behavior through neural pathways. I’m especially interested in how simple nervous systems, such as those in insects, produce complex, highly stereotyped behaviors. The <em>Drosophila</em>–<em>Entomophthora muscae</em> “zombie fly” system offers a unique model: the fungus infects and consumes the fly from within, ultimately controlling its behavior through the nervous system before death.</p>

<p><em>Dysregulation of circadian behaviors:</em> <em>E. muscae</em> triggers dramatic behavioral changes in <em>Drosophila</em> just before dusk, including summiting (a sharp increase in locomotion), proboscis extension and adhesion to a surface, and wing raising. Our lab recently found that infected flies also lose their characteristic circadian morning activity peak on the final day of life—a behavior governed by well-defined clock neurons. I am investigating what neural changes cause these circadian impairments.</p>

<p><em>Neural basis of summiting behavior:</em> Prior work in our lab identified the Pars Intercerebralis to Corpus Allatum (PI–CA) circuit as essential to summiting, implicating juvenile hormone release in the process. Disruption of this hormone abolishes summiting entirely. I am now exploring how neural activity changes in this circuit to enable such precise, parasite-driven behavioral control.</p>
